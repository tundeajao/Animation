Ms Caster Semenya came from a very poor family and grew up in the village of Fairlie, deep in South Africa's northern Limpopo province. She was raised up as a girl and for all intent and purposes considered herself a girl. She had always wanted to become an athlete and was active in sports from a young age. She is suffering from what is defined as hyperandrogenism which is a genetic condition. There are different variants of the disease, and in the case of Ms Semenya, she is genetically male i.e. each cell in her body has the XY chromosome. She has external female genitalia. Hence, both labia, large clitoris and a blind vagina which ends in a pouch. There is no Uterus (womb), Fallopian Tubes or Ovaries inside her. But inside her abdomen would be testis and these are producing a high level of testosterone, in the place the ovaries should be (I suspect that they will have to remove them at a later age and place her on hormone replacement therapy â€“ because there is a high possibility that they will become cancerous, this factor is very important to note as it concern her long term well being). I personally believe that we have intersex athletes taking part in female athletics from time memorial and there were no tests then. There is a racial element to it as she is black.
